## Description

This project was completed with the goal of practicing basic HTML concepts and 
utilizing common HTML tags.

## Self-Reflection

Completing this project was great for refreshing my knowledge of HTML, as well 
as getting a feel for the general workflow using git and github. I also learned 
of some best practices in web development such as using certain HTML tags and 
making my web pages accessible to any user.
