## Description

This project was completed with the goal of practicing basic HTML concepts and 
utilizing common HTML tags.

## Self-Reflection

Completing this project was great for refreshing my knowledge of HTML, as well 
as getting a feel for the general workflow using git and github. I also learned 
of some best practices in web development such as using certain HTML tags and 
making my web pages accessible to any user.

### Update After Styling With CSS

After getting a refresher on foundational CSS concepts and practices, I added 
some styling to this project. I learned and utilized various methods for 
selecting elements such as by type, class, or id, and through use of grouping 
and the descendant combinator. I also gained experience using basic properties 
that affect the position, size, color, and font of elements and their contents.
