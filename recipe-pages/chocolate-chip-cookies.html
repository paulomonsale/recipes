      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>If you love chocolate chip cookies that have a crispy exterior and a 
        thick, gooey interior, following this recipe will allow you to make a
        whole bunch.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie 
            sheets or line with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar and 
            white sugar until well blended. Beat in the vanilla, egg, and egg 
            yolk until light and creamy. Mix in the sifted ingredients until 
            just blended. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden 
            spoon. Drop cookie dough 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared cookie 
            sheets. Cookies should be about 3 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 to 17 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges 
            are lightly toasted. Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before 
            transferring to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
      </ol>
